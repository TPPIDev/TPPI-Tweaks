The ore spawning you'll see in this modpack will be a little different from what you are used to.~
~
Major metals used by multiple mods now spawn in "bands" of ore at 
more constrained Y levels.
~~~
This effectively buffs manual mining significantly, 
since you can specifically target ores you want in the world, 
while still keeping automatic mining and the amount of ores 
per chunk about the same as normal.
~~~
Ores spawn at a designated y-level, then have a maximum variance from that mean level. 
It will naturally concentrate the ores towards the middle of the range.~
~
Starting from the top of the world, here are the ores we've tweaked and where you can expect to find them:~
~~~
Copper:~
~
Spawns in the top layers of the world in generous chunks that are centered at y58, 
with the band itself extending about 7 blocks in either direction.~
~~~
TiC Aluminum:~
~
Aluminum can be found in small clusters of 3-4 ores 
randomly distributed between Y levels 44 and 62.~
~~~
Iron:~
~
Iron is located in large clusters centered at y48 of the world, 
extending about 13 blocks in either direction.~
~~~
Tin:~
~
This ore spawns in chunks roughly as large as copper's, centered at y37, 
again extending up to 7 blocks in either direction.
~~~
Certus Quartz:~
~
Spawns in somewhat sparse, but larger chunks 
randomly distributed between levels 36 and 54.~
~~~
Lead:~
~
You can find this ore in large, somewhat sparse clusters in the mid-upper 20s, 
(y28 to be exact) plus or minus 6 blocks.~
~~~
Silver:~
~
You can find this ore directly below and interspersed with lead, 
in slightly smaller chunks.~
~~~
Gold:~
~
You can find this ore in sparse, mid-sized chunks centered at the 18th y-level of the world, 
with a variance of 6.~
~~~
Osmium:~
~
You can find osmium from Mekanism in mid-sized clusters centered at y16, 
but with a wide variance of 14 blocks in either direction, 
extending from below lava level up to the silver and lead layers.~
~~~
Lapis:~
~
Lapis can be found centered at y15, but it has a high variance of 14, 
so it can appear as low as near bedrock and up near silver and lead, with a vein size slightly smaller than diamond.~
~~~
Redstone:~
~
Redstone is spawned in small, 4 ore clusters commonly in the low teens (y13), with a variance of 6, 
with some appearing up where gold is, and some also appearing at and below lava.~
~~~
Diamond:~
~
Diamond is unchanged from vanilla, in that it can spawn anywhere in the first 16 levels of the world. 
Veins are in sparse, small to mid sized clusters anywhere from the levels 1 to 16.~
~~~
Ferrous Ore:~
~
Spawns in mid-sized clusters found randomly between levels 6 and 16.~
~~~
Yellorite:~
~
Spawns in the bottom 9 layers of the world in rare, large chunks of ore. 
Dig below lava to find it.~
~~~
Coal:~
~
Like normal, with the exception that the ore veins are slightly larger and less frequently placed. 
Spawns anywhere from levels 0 to 128.
~~~
Unaffected Ores:~
~
-Dark Iron~
-Nether Ores~
-End Ores~
-Apatite~
-Sulfur~
-Thaumcraft Shards~
~~~
Have fun!
