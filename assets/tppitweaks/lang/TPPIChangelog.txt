**This is the file that TPPI Tweaks reads its info from, it is used for changelogs and information on the modpack**
**To add to the file, type what you want, and separate pages by using the phrase ~~~ **
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**

Example:
This is some very useful info
And I am typing it on multiple lines
~~~
Now I am on page 2
Still on page 2

**Begin line after asterisks**

Testing for the
book this
is ridiculously
short
lines
~~~
but I just
wanna see
